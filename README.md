# Leetcode Solutions in JS/Python

In no way do I condone plagiarism! I believe developers should attempt LeetCode problems on their own for self gain. Nonetheless, this repo was created as a way to document solutions I've submitted and my development journey for various problems of all difficulties, via JavaScript and Python. I hope developers can use these solutions when in need or as a different view on how problems can be solved. Feel free to leave comments and suggestions!
